# Prompt Assessment Results

This document presents the detailed assessment of prompt effectiveness based on the evaluation criteria established in `criteria_metrics.md`. Each prompt category was tested through multiple iterations to measure improvement and validate final effectiveness.

## Assessment Methodology

For each prompt category, I conducted three rounds of assessment:
1. **Initial Prompts**: Testing the first draft prompts
2. **Refined Prompts**: Testing the improved versions
3. **Final Optimized Prompts**: Testing the fully refined versions after user feedback

Each assessment used multiple parameter combinations to ensure prompt adaptability across different project contexts. Responses were evaluated against our six-dimension framework, with final scores calculated using the established weighting system.
