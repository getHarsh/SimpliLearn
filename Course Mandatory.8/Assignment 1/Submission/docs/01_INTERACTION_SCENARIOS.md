# Interaction Scenarios

## Overview

Based on my domain research, I've identified key interaction scenarios where project managers would likely seek assistance from a virtual project management consultant. These scenarios cover the four core areas: project planning, risk management, team collaboration, and performance tracking.

For each scenario, I've outlined typical queries that users might ask and the type of responses that would be most valuable to them. This information will directly inform the prompt design process.

## Industry-Specific Variations

Project management scenarios often vary by industry. I've identified specific variations for key industries:

### Software Development
- **Planning Focus:** Feature prioritization, sprint planning, release management
- **Risk Emphasis:** Technical debt, integration issues, requirement ambiguity
- **Collaboration Challenges:** Developer-QA relationships, technical vs. business communication
- **Metrics Priority:** Velocity, defect density, sprint completion rate

### Construction
- **Planning Focus:** Sequencing activities, resource scheduling, regulatory compliance
- **Risk Emphasis:** Safety issues, weather impacts, material availability, contractor coordination
- **Collaboration Challenges:** Subcontractor management, on-site vs. office communication
- **Metrics Priority:** Schedule variance, safety incidents, cost per square foot

### Healthcare
- **Planning Focus:** Regulatory compliance, stakeholder coordination, patient impact
- **Risk Emphasis:** Patient safety, compliance violations, staff adoption
- **Collaboration Challenges:** Clinical-IT collaboration, hierarchy navigation
- **Metrics Priority:** Compliance metrics, patient outcomes, staff efficiency

### Marketing
- **Planning Focus:** Campaign timing, creative process management, channel coordination
- **Risk Emphasis:** Market reception, brand consistency, timing conflicts
- **Collaboration Challenges:** Creative-analytical team dynamics, client communication
- **Metrics Priority:** Campaign ROI, engagement metrics, conversion rates

## Experience Level Variations

Project managers of different experience levels typically have different needs:

### Beginner Project Managers
- **Planning Needs:** Step-by-step guidance, templates, examples
- **Risk Focus:** Basic identification techniques, simple assessment frameworks
- **Collaboration Help:** Communication templates, meeting structures, basic conflict resolution
- **Metrics Support:** Straightforward KPIs, simple dashboards, report templates

### Intermediate Project Managers
- **Planning Needs:** Optimization techniques, efficiency improvements, stakeholder management

- **Collaboration Help:** Organizational dynamics, complex negotiations, cultural considerations
- **Metrics Support:** Predictive analytics, leading indicators, executive-level reporting

## Contextual Variations

For each scenario, responses should be adaptable to different:
1. **Project types** (software development, construction, marketing campaigns, etc.)
2. **Team sizes and structures** (small co-located teams vs. large distributed teams)
3. **Methodologies** (traditional/waterfall vs. agile approaches)
4. **Experience levels** (novice vs. experienced project managers)
5. **Organizational contexts** (corporate, startup, non-profit, etc.)
6. **Tool ecosystems** (Microsoft, Atlassian, open source, minimal tools)

## Scenario Prioritization

Based on frequency and impact analysis, I've prioritized these scenarios as follows:

1. **Highest Priority** (Most frequently needed, highest impact):
   - Creating a Project Plan (1A)
   - Risk Identification and Assessment (2A)
   - Resolving Team Conflicts (3B)

2. **Medium Priority** (Regularly needed, significant impact):
   - Defining Project Scope (1B)
   - Improving Team Communication (3A)
   - Setting Up Project Metrics (4A)

3. **Standard Priority** (Periodically needed):
   - Risk Response Planning (2B)
   - Reporting Project Status (4B)

This prioritization will inform the order of prompt development and the depth of refinement efforts.

## Conclusion

These scenarios provide a framework for designing prompts that address real-world project management challenges. The next step is to develop initial prompts for each scenario that effectively guide ChatGPT to provide practical, relevant, and actionable advice.

By ensuring the prompts are adaptable to different industries, experience levels, and project contexts, the virtual project management consultant will be able to provide valuable guidance across a wide range of scenarios.
