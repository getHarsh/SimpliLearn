# Decision Points Framework

This document outlines the structure and best practices for creating meaningful choice points in our interactive narrative. Well-designed decision points are critical for player engagement and creating a genuinely branching story experience.

## Decision Point Types

### Pivotal Decisions
- **Definition**: Major choices that significantly alter the narrative direction
- **Frequency**: 3-5 throughout the story
- **Impact**: Creates distinct story branches with substantial variation
- **Design Principle**: Should reflect core thematic questions

### Characterization Decisions
- **Definition**: Choices that primarily define the protagonist's personality and values
- **Frequency**: Interspersed throughout, especially early
- **Impact**: Influences relationship dynamics and later options
- **Design Principle**: Options should represent different but valid approaches

### Tactical Decisions
- **Definition**: Practical choices about how to approach specific situations
- **Frequency**: Regular intervals between pivotal moments
- **Impact**: Affects success/failure of immediate goals
- **Design Principle**: Should have clear risk/reward tradeoffs

### Relationship Decisions
- **Definition**: Choices specifically impacting connections with other characters
- **Frequency**: At key character interaction points
- **Impact**: Alters relationship trajectories and support availability
- **Design Principle**: Should balance multiple competing relationships

## Decision Point Structure

### Core Components
1. **Situation Presentation**: Clear description of the circumstances requiring a choice
2. **Stakes Clarification**: What hangs in the balance (explicit or implicit)
3. **Option Presentation**: Typically 2-3 clearly differentiated choices
4. **Impact Indication**: Subtle hints about potential consequences without obviousness

### Balanced Option Design
For each decision point, options should be balanced across these factors:
- **Moral Clarity**: Mix of clearly ethical, ambiguous, and pragmatic choices
- **Risk Level**: Balance of safe, moderate risk, and high-risk options
- **Information Completeness**: Vary between choices with clear vs. uncertain outcomes
- **Value Prioritization**: Different options prioritize different legitimate values

## Narrative Implementation

### Setting Up Decisions
Effective decision points require proper setup through:
1. Providing necessary context for informed choices
2. Establishing clear motivations for different options
3. Creating genuine tension about the right approach
4. Ensuring all options feel viable within character

### Sample Decision Format
```
[Situation Description]
The protagonist faces [specific situation] which requires a decision about [central question].

[Stakes Description]
Making this choice will determine [immediate consequence] and potentially affect [longer-term implication].

OPTIONS:
1. [First option] - [Brief implication]
2. [Second option] - [Brief implication]
3. [Third option] - [Brief implication]

What does the protagonist choose to do?
```

### Follow-Through Guidelines
After a choice is made:
1. Show immediate consequences within 1-2 paragraphs
2. Acknowledge the choice explicitly in narrative
3. Have other characters react to the decision
4. Begin setting up ramifications that will emerge later

## Branching Management

### Primary Branch Points
- First major decision creates primary narrative paths
- Subsequent major decisions create sub-branches
- Track branch positioning with clear labeling system
- Allow for occasional branch convergence to manage complexity

### Branch Variation Types
1. **Plot Variation**: Different events and circumstances occur
2. **Character Reaction Variation**: Same events with different relationship impacts
3. **Information Variation**: Different knowledge available to protagonist
4. **Tone Variation**: Similar events with different emotional emphasis

### Maintaining Coherence Across Branches
- Core story world rules remain consistent regardless of path
- Major external events occur in all branches (though experienced differently)
- Character core personalities remain consistent (though relationships may vary)
- Central theme explored in all paths (though from different angles)

## Decision Tracking

### Choice Memory Integration
- Reference previous significant choices in narrative
- Have characters recall and respond to protagonist's established patterns
- Modify available options based on previous path
- Create callbacks to earlier decisions for continuity

### Decision Consequence Timing
Balance these different consequence timeframes:
- **Immediate consequences**: Direct results visible right away
- **Short-term consequences**: Effects emerging within next chapter
- **Mid-range consequences**: Impacts appearing after several choices
- **Culmination consequences**: Effects primarily visible in ending

## Designing for Multiple Endings

### Ending Determination Approach
- Map how patterns of choices lead to specific conclusions
- Create matrices showing which combination of pivotal choices lead to which endings
- Ensure each ending feels earned based on previous decisions
- Allow similar choices to lead to ending variations rather than identical conclusions

### Ending Satisfaction Criteria
Regardless of which ending is reached, ensure:
1. Thematic questions are meaningfully addressed
2. Protagonist's arc reaches appropriate conclusion
3. Key relationships receive resolution
4. Central plot tensions are resolved (though perhaps differently)
5. Player choices feel honored and significant

## Implementation Prompting

When creating decision points through ChatGPT, effective prompts should:
1. Clearly state the narrative context leading to the choice
2. Specify the type of decision point needed
3. Request balanced options with distinct implications
4. Ask for subtle implementation that maintains tension
5. Request logical consequences that honor player agency

Using this framework ensures our interactive narrative offers meaningful choices that create genuinely different experiences while maintaining overall story coherence and quality.
