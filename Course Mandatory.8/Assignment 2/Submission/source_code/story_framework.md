# Interactive Storytelling Framework

## Overview
This framework outlines the structure for creating an interactive story using ChatGPT. It provides a systematic approach to developing branching narratives with meaningful player choices.

## Core Narrative Components

### 1. Central Premise
- A compelling situation that creates immediate interest
- A clear initial problem or question for the protagonist
- Enough background context for reader investment
- A hook that leads naturally to the first choice

### 2. Protagonist Framework
- Relatable main character with clear motivation
- Room for reader to project onto character
- Sufficient backstory to ground decisions
- Traits that remain consistent across all paths

### 3. Choice Architecture
- 2-3 meaningful options at each decision point
- Clear but unpredictable consequences
- Options that reflect different values or approaches
- No obvious "correct" choices

### 4. Branch Management
- Major branches for significant divergence
- Minor variations within main branches
- Occasional convergence points to maintain narrative manageability
- Consistent world rules across all paths

### 5. Narrative Pacing
- Regular decision points (every 2-3 paragraphs of text)
- Mix of immediate and delayed consequences
- Rising tension regardless of path taken
- Clear narrative arcs within each branch

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up Decision Points
```
[SCENE DESCRIPTION]
The protagonist faces a situation requiring a choice.

OPTIONS:
1. [First option with brief implication]
2. [Second option with brief implication]
3. [Third option with brief implication]

What does the protagonist choose to do?
```

### Tracking Decision History
```
STORY PATH:
- First major decision: [Choice made]
- Second major decision: [Choice made]
- Current situation: [Brief description]

QUESTION: [Next decision point]
```

### Maintaining Thematic Consistency
- Identify 2-3 core themes for the story
- Ensure all branches explore these themes, even if reaching different conclusions
- Use recurring motifs or symbols across different paths
- Ensure character growth is consistent with earlier choices

### Creating Satisfying Conclusions
- 3-5 distinct ending types based on pattern of choices
- Each ending should feel earned based on previous decisions
- Provide emotional closure regardless of path taken
- Leave appropriate space for reader interpretation

## Development Sequence
1. Create central premise and protagonist
2. Map primary branches from first major choice
3. Develop key decision points for each branch
4. Design conclusion for each major path
5. Add minor variations and texture
6. Test for narrative consistency across paths

This framework will guide our interactive storytelling development process, ensuring engaging narratives with meaningful choices and satisfying outcomes.
