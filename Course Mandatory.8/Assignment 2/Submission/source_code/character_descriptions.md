# Character Development Framework

This document outlines the approach for creating compelling, consistent characters for our interactive narrative. Well-developed characters ensure reader investment in choices and maintain narrative cohesion across branching paths.

## Protagonist Development Template

### Core Identity Elements
- **Name**: [Name with meaningful etymology/reference if relevant]
- **Age Range**: [Specific enough to ground character, flexible enough for reader projection]
- **Background**: [Key formative experiences that shape decisions]
- **Occupation/Role**: [Current position relevant to story situation]
- **Key Relationships**: [Connections that influence decisions and stakes]

### Character Psychology
- **Core Motivation**: [Primary driving force behind actions]
- **Internal Conflict**: [Tension between competing values or desires]
- **External Conflict**: [Primary obstacle or challenge faced]
- **Character Flaw**: [Limitation that creates vulnerability or mistakes]
- **Character Strength**: [Asset that helps overcome challenges]

### Decision-Making Framework
- **Ethical Framework**: [How character evaluates right/wrong]
- **Risk Tolerance**: [Approach to uncertainty and danger]
- **Loyalty Structure**: [Priorities regarding relationships/commitments]
- **Processing Style**: [Emotional vs. analytical, impulsive vs. deliberate]
- **Adaptation Capacity**: [How character grows through challenges]

### Consistent Representation
- **Speech Pattern**: [Distinctive verbal habits, vocabulary level, expressions]
- **Physical Mannerisms**: [Gestures, posture, characteristic movements]
- **Thought Process**: [How internal monologue is expressed]
- **Emotional Responses**: [Typical reactions to stress, joy, fear, etc.]
- **Value Expressions**: [How beliefs manifest in decisions]

## Supporting Character Template

### Narrative Function
- **Role in Story**: [Helper, mentor, obstacle, foil, etc.]
- **Relationship to Protagonist**: [Connection creating tension/support]
- **Perspective Offered**: [Unique viewpoint on story's central questions]
- **Information Access**: [What this character knows that others don't]

### Character Dynamics
- **Wants from Protagonist**: [Character's goal regarding main character]
- **Gives to Protagonist**: [Support, challenge, information, etc.]
- **Conflict Source**: [How this character creates tension]
- **Arc Potential**: [How character might change through story]

### Consistency Across Branches
- **Core Traits**: [Aspects that remain consistent regardless of player choices]
- **Variable Reactions**: [How character responds differently to different choices]
- **Relationship Development Range**: [How relationship can evolve based on choices]

## Antagonistic Forces Framework

### External Antagonists
- **Motivation**: [Comprehensible reason for opposition]
- **Methodology**: [Characteristic approach to creating obstacles]
- **Vulnerability**: [Potential weakness or limitation]
- **View of Protagonist**: [How antagonist perceives main character]

### Situational Antagonism
- **Environmental Pressures**: [Non-character obstacles]
- **Time Constraints**: [Deadlines creating urgency]
- **Resource Limitations**: [Scarcity creating difficult choices]
- **Social/Systemic Constraints**: [Rules, laws, norms creating barriers]

### Internal Antagonism
- **Self-Defeating Patterns**: [Protagonist's own limitations]
- **Conflicting Values**: [When protagonist's own beliefs create tension]
- **Past Trauma Effects**: [How history influences present challenges]
- **Identity Questions**: [Self-concept challenges relevant to decisions]

## Character Consistency Management

To maintain character consistency across branching narratives:

1. **Core vs. Variable Traits**: Clearly distinguish which character aspects remain consistent regardless of path taken and which may evolve based on choices.

2. **Decision-Based Evolution**: Map how specific choices would logically impact character development, ensuring changes feel earned.

3. **Relationship Tracking**: Document how relationships between characters evolve based on decisions to maintain interpersonal consistency.

4. **Voice Consistency**: Develop specific linguistic patterns for each character and apply them consistently across branches.

5. **Motivation Coherence**: Ensure character decisions always connect to established motivations, even when making different choices on different paths.

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing characters through ChatGPT prompts:

1. Always reference core character traits when requesting narrative content
2. Include relevant character history when asking for reactions to new situations
3. Provide clear direction on how characters should evolve based on previous choices
4. Request consistent representation of speech patterns and thought processes
5. Ask for explicit connections between character motivations and their actions

By following this framework, we can create characters who remain recognizable across different story branches while still evolving in response to player choices in ways that feel natural and earned.
