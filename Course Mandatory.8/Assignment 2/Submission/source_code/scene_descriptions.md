# Scene Description Framework

This document outlines the approach for creating effective scene descriptions in our interactive narrative. Well-crafted scenes establish setting, atmosphere, and context while maintaining consistency across different story branches.

## Scene Structure Elements

### Setting Components
- **Physical Environment**: Specific location details that ground the scene
- **Temporal Context**: Time of day, season, era, or other chronological markers
- **Sensory Atmosphere**: Dominant sensory impressions (visual, auditory, etc.)
- **Social Context**: Interpersonal dynamics or cultural elements present
- **Technological Context**: Relevant technology present or notably absent

### Narrative Function Indicators
- **Tone Establishment**: Emotional atmosphere conveyed through description
- **Thematic Reinforcement**: Elements that emphasize central themes
- **Character Reflection**: Environment details that mirror character states
- **Tension Building**: Descriptive elements that create or release tension
- **Choice Framing**: How the scene leads naturally to decision points

### Description Depth Categories
- **Establishing Descriptions**: Comprehensive scene-setting (200-300 words)
- **Transitional Descriptions**: Brief contextual shifts (50-100 words)
- **Reaction Descriptions**: Environment changes reflecting consequences (75-150 words)
- **Focal Descriptions**: Detailed examination of specific elements (variable length)

## Scene Creation Guidelines

### Sensory Engagement Principles
1. **Prioritize Visual Anchors**: Provide clear visual references that readers can mentally picture
2. **Layer Secondary Senses**: Add sounds, smells, textures strategically for depth
3. **Use Kinesthetic Elements**: Incorporate movement, temperature, and physical sensations
4. **Balance Direct and Implied Sensory Information**: Some details explicitly stated, others suggested
5. **Connect Sensory Details to Emotional Impact**: How environments make characters feel

### Technological Environment Development
For our near-future setting focusing on digital consciousness:
1. **Familiar Foundation**: Begin with recognizable technology as baseline
2. **Strategic Innovation**: Introduce 2-3 specific technological advances central to the story
3. **Implied Advancement**: Suggest broader technological change through environmental details
4. **Consistent Rules**: Establish clear limitations/capabilities of core technologies
5. **Human Integration**: Show how technology has shaped environments and interactions

### Emotional Atmosphere Creation
- **Environmental Mirroring**: Setting elements that reflect emotional states
- **Weather and Light Modulation**: Natural elements that enhance mood
- **Space and Proximity Management**: How physical distance creates emotional tone
- **Object Significance**: Using specific items to create emotional resonance
- **Contrast Utilization**: Juxtaposing elements to heighten emotional impact

## Branch Consistency Management

### Maintaining Setting Continuity
1. **Core Location Documentation**: Define unchanging elements of recurring locations
2. **Branch-Specific Modifications**: Document how environments change in different paths
3. **Environmental State Tracking**: Monitor how locations evolve based on story events
4. **Sensory Signatures**: Establish consistent sensory profiles for recurring settings
5. **Temporal Progression Markers**: Consistent indicators of time passing across branches

### Adaptive Description Techniques
- **Decision-Based Detail Shifting**: How environments reflect previous choices
- **Consistent Baseline with Variable Elements**: Core descriptions with modification points
- **Character Perception Filtering**: How protagonist's state influences description style
- **Thematic Emphasis Variation**: Different descriptive focus based on path themes
- **Parametric Description Components**: Modular elements that can be reconfigured based on path

## Scene Types and Special Considerations

### Critical Scene Types

#### 1. Discovery Scenes
- **Purpose**: Revealing new information or possibilities
- **Focus Areas**: Character reaction, information clarity, implications
- **Structure**: Initial observation → detail expansion → significance realization
- **Example Scenario**: Maya discovering Eleanor's hidden research

#### 2. Confrontation Scenes
- **Purpose**: Addressing conflicts between characters or values
- **Focus Areas**: Tension building, power dynamics, environmental pressure
- **Structure**: Setting tension → positioning → escalation → resolution state
- **Example Scenario**: Maya defending her decisions to the Ethics Committee

#### 3. Decision Moment Scenes
- **Purpose**: Framing choice points with appropriate weight
- **Focus Areas**: Stakes clarity, option differentiation, atmospheric pressure
- **Structure**: Situation establishment → consideration space → option emergence
- **Example Scenario**: Maya deciding whether to activate ELEANOR fully

#### 4. Consequence Revelation Scenes
- **Purpose**: Showing outcomes of previous choices
- **Focus Areas**: Cause-effect clarity, emotional impact, new situation parameters
- **Structure**: Initial state → revelation process → new reality establishment
- **Example Scenario**: First interaction with fully conscious ELEANOR

### Technology Representation Guidelines

For depicting the ELEANOR system and other consciousness technology:

1. **Interface Visualization**: Clear description of how humans interact with the technology
2. **Consciousness Indicators**: Consistent signals of ELEANOR's awareness and state
3. **Environmental Integration**: How the technology exists within physical spaces
4. **Limitation Clarification**: Physical and operational constraints made evident
5. **Evolution Representation**: Visual/sensory cues that indicate development over time

## Implementation Through ChatGPT

When creating scene descriptions through ChatGPT prompts:

1. **Specify Scene Type and Function**: Clearly indicate the narrative purpose
2. **Provide Contextual History**: Note relevant previous events and choices
3. **Indicate Emotional Tone**: Specify the desired atmospheric quality
4. **Request Sensory Balance**: Ask for specific sensory elements to emphasize
5. **Note Consistency Requirements**: Highlight elements that must align with established settings

### Sample Prompting Format
```
SCENE TYPE: [Discovery/Confrontation/Decision/Consequence]
LOCATION: [Specific setting]
PREVIOUS EVENTS: [Relevant history affecting this scene]
EMOTIONAL TONE: [Desired atmosphere]
NECESSARY ELEMENTS: [Critical components to include]
KEY CHARACTERS PRESENT: [Who is in the scene]
SENSORY FOCUS: [Which senses should be emphasized]
APPROXIMATE LENGTH: [Word count target]
TRANSITION TO: [What follows this scene]
```

By following these guidelines, we can create vivid, consistent scene descriptions that adapt appropriately to different narrative branches while maintaining overall story coherence and emotional impact.
