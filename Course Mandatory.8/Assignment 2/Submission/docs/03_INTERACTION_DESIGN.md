# Interaction Design

## Interaction Philosophy

For this interactive storytelling experience, I've designed the interaction points to fulfill several key criteria:

1. **Meaningful Impact**: Each choice significantly influences the narrative direction rather than creating only surface-level variations
2. **Ethical Weight**: Decisions connect to the core philosophical questions of the story
3. **Character Development**: Choices reflect and impact Maya's internal journey and her relationships with other characters
4. **Balanced Options**: Each decision point offers options with legitimate pros and cons rather than obvious "right" answers
5. **Narrative Cohesion**: Despite branching paths, all storylines maintain thematic consistency and narrative quality

## Decision Point Structure

Each major decision point follows a consistent structure:

### 1. Situation Presentation
- Detailed description of the current scenario
- Clear stakes and pressures influencing the decision
- Relevant information from different perspectives

### 2. Decision Options
- Typically 2-3 clearly defined choices
- Each option presented with its immediate implications
- No overtly "correct" choiceâ€”all have legitimate justifications

### 3. Immediate Consequences
- Direct narrative response to the user's choice
- Character reactions and immediate outcomes
- New narrative direction established

## Major Decision Points

The story is structured around three tiers of major decision points that significantly alter the narrative path:

### Decision Point 1: Initial Response
*How does Maya initially respond to discovering Eleanor's ELEANOR system?*
- **Report to Ethics Committee** (institutional path): Follow official protocols, prioritizing established ethical guidelines
- **Investigate Privately** (investigation path): Explore the system before making official disclosure, prioritizing understanding
- **Complete Integration** (activation path): Proceed with activation, prioritizing technological development and continuation

### Decision Point 2: Approach Framework
*How does Maya approach the development or management of ELEANOR?*

From Institutional Path:
- **Maximum Restriction**: Prioritize strict protocols and clear boundaries
- **Guided Flexibility**: Balance oversight with appropriate adaptations
- **Family Privacy**: Create space for personal connection within institutional framework

From Investigation Path:
- **Private Research**: Maintain complete independence with personal resources
- **Corporate Collaboration**: Partner with NeuraLink for resources and protection
- **Selective Academic Involvement**: Build a trusted circle of academic colleagues

From Activation Path:
- **Research Potential**: Emphasize ELEANOR's value as unprecedented research asset
- **Entity Rights**: Advocate for ELEANOR as a new category of conscious entity
- **External Oversight**: Create balanced multi-stakeholder governance

### Decision Point 3: Resolution Direction
*How does Maya resolve the core philosophical and practical challenges?*

Each second-level branch presents a third major choice that leads toward specific ending types:

From Institutional Path branches:
- Options emphasizing ethical boundaries, institutional collaboration, or interpersonal connections

From Investigation Path branches:
- Options emphasizing academic return, corporate protection, or independent networks

From Activation Path branches:
- Options emphasizing graduated rights, limited compliance, or public-interest initiatives

## Interactive Implementation

The interaction system is implemented through a simple but effective linking system:

1. **Main storyline.md** presents the opening scenario and first major choice
2. **Each choice links to a specific path file** (e.g., institutional_path.md)
3. **Second choices link to more specific branch files** (e.g., institutional_path_restricted.md)
4. **Third choices link to resolution files** that then connect to endings

This approach allows readers to navigate through their chosen path while maintaining narrative coherence. The system is technically simple but provides a rich interactive experience by focusing on the quality of the narrative branching rather than complex interaction mechanics.

## User Experience Considerations

The interaction design emphasizes:

1. **Clarity of Choice**: Options are presented directly at the end of each segment
2. **Narrative Integration**: Decisions flow naturally from the story context
3. **Balanced Alternatives**: Each option has legitimate reasoning and consequences
4. **Agency Respect**: Choices truly matter to the narrative direction
5. **Consistency of Character**: Maya remains recognizable regardless of path taken

## Choice Architecture Design

The choice architecture is designed to explore different philosophical approaches to the central questions:

1. **Institutional vs. Individual Authority**: Who should make decisions about unprecedented technology?
2. **Preservation vs. Evolution**: Should ELEANOR maintain Eleanor's identity or develop her own?
3. **Control vs. Autonomy**: What boundaries should exist around consciousness technology?
4. **Scientific vs. Personal Connection**: Is ELEANOR primarily a research subject or a person?

Different decision paths allow readers to explore these questions from multiple perspectives, with each ending offering a different philosophical resolution without declaring any single approach correct.

## Path Tracking

The narrative maintains awareness of previous choices through:

1. **State References**: Characters refer to decisions made earlier in the story
2. **Environmental Consequences**: The physical settings reflect previous choices
3. **Relationship Evolution**: Character interactions change based on previous decisions
4. **Option Availability**: Some later choices are only available based on earlier decisions

This creates a sense of continuity and consequence throughout the branching narrative, ensuring that player choices feel meaningful and impactful throughout the experience.
