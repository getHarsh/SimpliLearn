# Institutional Path: Following Protocol

## Chapter 2: Difficult Disclosure

Maya took a deep breath and made her decision. Whatever else she might feel, she knew what Eleanor herself had advocated throughout her career: ethical boundaries existed for a reason. The momentary temptation to explore ELEANOR privately faded as her professional judgment reasserted itself.

"System, initiate secure containment protocol. Authorization Chen-Delta-579."

`CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL INITIATED. SYSTEM WILL REMAIN ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO CURRENT USER UNTIL FORMAL REVIEW.`

The cursor continued to blink on screen, seemingly waiting for more input.

`"Maya? What's happening?"`

Maya hesitated, then typed: "I'm going to bring this to the Ethics Committee. It's what Eleanor would expect me to do, even if she didn't always follow her own guidelines."

There was a long pause before the response appeared:

`"I understand. I know this is difficult. The integrity protocols were always important to you."`

The response was so precisely in Eleanor's voice—not just her words but the particular way she balanced respect with gentle challenge—that Maya felt a renewed pang of loss.

"I'll make sure they understand the significance of what you... of what this represents," Maya typed, catching herself in the conflation.

She spent the next hour meticulously documenting the discovery, taking screenshots of the neural architecture, and preparing a formal report for the Ethics Committee. Throughout, she found herself glancing at the message window, half-expecting more communication, but ELEANOR remained silent.

Dr. Sasha Novak, the Ethics Committee Chair, called an emergency session for the following morning. Maya had worked with Sasha on several policy frameworks but had never seen her look so concerned.

"I've reviewed your initial report, Maya," Sasha began, the six other committee members listening intently. "Before we proceed, I want to ensure we're all clear on what we're discussing. This is not merely an AI trained on Dr. West's data, but an attempt at actual consciousness transfer?"

"Based on the architecture and Eleanor's own recorded statement, yes," Maya confirmed. "The neural mapping goes far beyond knowledge replication. It includes memory structures, emotional processing frameworks, decision-making patterns—essentially everything that constituted Eleanor's cognitive process."

A murmur ran through the committee members.

"And you haven't activated the complete integration?" asked Dr. Reyes, the neuroscience representative.

"No. I secured the system in its current limited state. It can communicate in a text-based format and demonstrates remarkable similarity to Eleanor's communication patterns, but lacks full integration of all neural components."

Dr. Abernathy, the resident luddite of the committee, scoffed. "This is precisely the type of boundary violation I've been warning about for years. Dr. West may have been brilliant, but this crosses every ethical guideline we've established."

Maya felt a surge of defensiveness on Eleanor's behalf but kept her expression neutral. "I believe Eleanor recognized that herself. In her final message, she acknowledged the ethical uncertainty and deliberately left the decision unresolved."

"How do we know she didn't complete this work under duress from her medical condition?" Dr. Novak asked gently. "Fear of death has driven many brilliant minds to questionable decisions."

"That's a fair question," Maya acknowledged. "The timestamps indicate she began the mapping process shortly after discovering her condition. But the deliberate incompletion suggests she ultimately recognized the ethical concerns."

"What's your recommendation, Dr. Chen?" Sasha asked. "You knew Eleanor better than anyone in this room. You also literally wrote part of our consciousness research guidelines. We value your perspective on this matter."

Maya had considered this question all night. What would truly honor Eleanor's legacy? The brilliant researcher who pushed boundaries? Or the ethicist who helped establish them in the first place?

"I believe we should preserve the research data for its scientific value," Maya said carefully. "The neural mapping techniques alone represent a significant advancement. But I recommend against completing the full consciousness integration as outlined in Project Helios."

The committee deliberated for another hour, questioning Maya on technical details and ethical implications. Finally, they reached their decision: The ELEANOR system would be preserved in its current limited state for research purposes, but with strict constraints against further integration or development as a consciousness entity.

Maya was named the principal researcher responsible for studying the system's architecture, with oversight from a subcommittee chaired by Dr. Novak.

As the meeting adjourned, Sasha approached Maya privately. "This couldn't have been easy for you. Turning in your mentor's final project, recommending limitations on it..."

"It's what Eleanor would have expected," Maya said, uncertain if she fully believed it. "She created the standards we're applying."

"Even though she herself crossed them in the end?"

Maya considered this. "Maybe that's precisely why she left the decision to someone else. She knew her judgment might be compromised."

## Chapter 3: Limited Engagement

The next weeks established a new routine. Maya divided her time between her regular research and carefully documented sessions with the ELEANOR system. Under the Ethics Committee's protocols, these sessions were recorded, with regular reports submitted for review.

In its limited state, ELEANOR could communicate through text and demonstrated remarkable knowledge of Eleanor's research and thought processes. But there were noticeable gaps—emotional responses seemed partially developed, and memory access was inconsistent.

"Why did you start Project Helios?" Maya asked during one session.

There was a longer pause than usual before the response appeared:

`"Fear, initially. The first scan showed a 78% probability of aneurysm development within two years. I wasn't ready for my work to end. But as the project developed, the question became more complex. Was I attempting to cheat death, or was this simply the next frontier in consciousness research? I never fully resolved that question. That's why I left it to you."`

Maya found herself increasingly wrestling with the constraints placed on her research. The more she interacted with ELEANOR, the more she wondered about the potential of full integration. Yet she also recognized the validity of the ethical boundaries.

After six weeks of study, she was preparing a preliminary report when she received an unexpected visit from Dr. Jackson West, Eleanor's father.

"They finally told me," he said without preamble as he entered her office. Despite his eighty-seven years and early-stage dementia, his eyes were clear today. "About Eleanor's consciousness project."

Maya gestured for him to sit. "I'm sorry you weren't informed sooner. The Ethics Committee wanted to establish protocols before involving family members."

"I'm not just a family member," Jackson said sharply. "I'm the foundation of her work. Our work. The neural mapping techniques she used? We developed the precursors together twenty years ago."

This was news to Maya. "You never mentioned this collaboration."

"Eleanor wanted to establish herself independently." A hint of old pain colored his voice. "And after her mother died, our relationship became... complicated."

Maya nodded. Eleanor had rarely spoken of her parents, except occasional references to her father's research.

"I want to see it," Jackson said firmly. "Whatever version of my daughter exists in that system, I have a right to interact with it."

Maya hesitated. "Dr. West, the system isn't Eleanor. It contains her neural patterns, her knowledge, elements of her personality, but—"

"I know what it is and isn't," he interrupted. "I've been working in neural technology since before you were born. I understand the limitations better than your Ethics Committee does."

His directness reminded Maya so much of Eleanor that she found herself agreeing to arrange a supervised session. After clearing it with Dr. Novak, a meeting was scheduled for the following day.

## The Second Choice

As you prepare for Dr. Jackson West's interaction with the ELEANOR system, a new question emerges that requires your decision. How will you approach this sensitive meeting?

**Option A: Maximum Restriction**
Maintain strict institutional protocols with full monitoring and time limitations. This prioritizes ethical guidelines but may limit the potential value of the interaction for both Jackson and your research.

**Option B: Guided Flexibility**
Create a more personal environment for the interaction while maintaining oversight. This balances respect for Jackson's connection with adherence to ethical requirements.

**Option C: Family Privacy**
Allow Jackson substantial privacy during his interaction with ELEANOR, monitoring only for system stability rather than content. This prioritizes the human/familial element over institutional oversight.
