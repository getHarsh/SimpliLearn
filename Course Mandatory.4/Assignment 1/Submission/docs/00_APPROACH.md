# AAL Sales Analysis - Study Notes and Approach

## Project Understanding
Working through the AAL sales analysis project to understand Australian retail patterns. This is my approach based on the course materials and practice exercises.

## Learning Objectives
- Master data wrangling techniques
- Apply statistical analysis methods
- Create effective visualizations
- Generate comprehensive business reports

## Implementation Notes

### Data Analysis Strategy
From my practice with similar datasets, I've found this approach works best:
1. Start with thorough data cleaning
2. Apply statistical methods systematically
3. Create visualizations iteratively
4. Build comprehensive insights

### Tools Selection
Based on course exercises and personal testing:
- Pandas: Efficient for large dataset manipulation
- Seaborn: Best for statistical visualizations
- NumPy: Essential for numerical computations
- SciPy: Advanced statistical analysis

### Visualization Approach
Through trial and error, found these work best:
- Box plots for comparing distributions
- Time series for trend analysis
- Heatmaps for correlation studies
- Interactive dashboards for presentation

### Key Learnings
Notes from course practice:
1. Always validate data quality first
2. Use normalization for better comparisons
3. Create clear, business-focused visualizations
4. Document insights thoroughly
