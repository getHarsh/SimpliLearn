   - Income data validation
   - Missing value assessment

2. Data Preparation
   - Demographic-based imputation
   - Feature engineering
   - Encoding implementation

3. Statistical Analysis
   - Distribution analysis
   - Outlier treatment
   - Hypothesis testing

4. Visualization Development
   - Product performance analysis
   - Campaign effectiveness study
   - Demographic pattern analysis

## Implementation Framework
