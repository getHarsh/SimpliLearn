# Approach to House Loan Data Analysis

## Overview

For this project, I developed a comprehensive approach to predict loan defaults using deep learning techniques. The challenge was to build a model that could effectively identify potential loan defaults from historical data, despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

## Methodology

I structured my approach into several key phases:

### 1. Problem Understanding

I began by thoroughly understanding the problem space:
- **Domain Knowledge**: Familiarizing myself with finance-specific factors that influence loan repayment
- **Business Impact**: Understanding the consequences of false positives (denying loans to creditworthy applicants) versus false negatives (approving loans that will default)
- **Success Criteria**: Defining the evaluation metrics that would determine model success, with a focus on sensitivity and AUC

### 2. Data Exploration and Preparation

This phase involved several critical steps:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examining the distribution of features and target variable
- **Missing Value Handling**: Implementing appropriate strategies for handling null values
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features that could help predict loan defaults
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting incorrect or inconsistent data
- **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Using SMOTE to balance the classes in the training data

### 3. Model Development

I chose to implement a deep neural network using TensorFlow and Keras:
- **Architecture Selection**: Testing various network architectures to find the optimal structure
- **Regularization**: Implementing techniques like dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters
- **Training Strategy**: Using callbacks for early stopping and checkpointing to save the best model

### 4. Model Evaluation

I evaluated the model using several metrics with a focus on:
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: The ability to correctly identify actual defaults
- **ROC AUC**: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Understanding the types of errors the model made
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which features contributed most to the model's predictions

### 5. Interpretation and Insights

The final phase focused on extracting actionable insights:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common patterns among predicted defaults
- **Threshold Optimization**: Finding the optimal probability threshold for classifying loans
- **Business Recommendations**: Translating model findings into actionable business strategies

## Technical Approach Details

### Data Processing Strategy
- I used median imputation for missing numerical values and mode imputation for categorical features
- Implemented IQR-based outlier handling to manage extreme values
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables with multiple levels
- Used correlation analysis to remove highly correlated features (threshold > 0.75)

### Model Architecture Strategy
- Implemented a feed-forward neural network with multiple hidden layers
- Used ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer
- Applied batch normalization to stabilize learning
- Implemented dropout to prevent overfitting
- Used early stopping to terminate training when validation metrics stopped improving

### Evaluation Strategy
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- Used stratified sampling to maintain class distribution in splits
- Applied SMOTE to balance the training data
- Evaluated performance on the original (imbalanced) test data
- Used ROC AUC and sensitivity as primary metrics

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Class Imbalance**
   - **Challenge**: The dataset had a significant imbalance between defaulted and non-defaulted loans
   - **Solution**: Implemented SMOTE to create synthetic examples of the minority class

2. **High Dimensionality**
   - **Challenge**: The dataset contained many features, increasing the risk of overfitting
   - **Solution**: Applied feature selection techniques and regularization in the neural network

3. **Interpretability**
   - **Challenge**: Deep learning models are often seen as "black boxes"
   - **Solution**: Supplemented the neural network with feature importance analysis using a tree-based model

## Conclusion

This methodical approach allowed me to build a robust model that effectively predicts loan defaults while addressing the challenges of an imbalanced dataset. The combination of thorough data preprocessing, appropriate handling of class imbalance, and a well-designed neural network architecture resulted in a model with strong predictive performance.
