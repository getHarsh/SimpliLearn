# Exploratory Data Analysis Findings

This document presents the key findings from my exploratory data analysis of the house loan dataset.

## Overview

Before building predictive models, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and gain insights that would inform my modeling approach.

## Dataset Characteristics

The dataset contained loan application information with the following properties:
- **Size**: [Number of rows Ã— Number of columns]
- **Target Variable**: 'TARGET' (binary: 0 = loan repaid, 1 = loan defaulted)
- **Feature Types**: Mix of numerical (continuous and discrete) and categorical variables

## Target Variable Analysis

The analysis of the TARGET variable revealed significant class imbalance:

```python
target_counts = df['TARGET'].value_counts()
target_percentages = (target_counts / len(df)) * 100
```

This produced the following distribution:
- **Class 0 (Loan Repaid)**: [X]% of the dataset
- **Class 1 (Loan Defaulted)**: [Y]% of the dataset

This imbalance is expected in loan default prediction problems, as most loans are repaid on time. However, this imbalance presented a modeling challenge that needed to be addressed.

## Missing Value Analysis

I identified columns with missing values:

```python
null_values = df.isnull().sum()
null_percentages = (null_values / len(df)) * 100
```

Key findings:
- [X] features had missing values
- [Y] features had more than 20% missing values
- Missing values appeared to be [pattern of missingness - random, systematic, etc.]

These findings guided my approach to missing value imputation in the data wrangling phase.

## Numerical Features Analysis

I analyzed the distributions and relationships of numerical features:

### Distribution of Key Numerical Features

I examined the distributions of important numerical features using histograms and box plots:

```python
# Example of distribution analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
for i, col in enumerate(numerical_cols[:12]):
    plt.subplot(4, 3, i+1)
    sns.histplot(df[col], kde=True)
    plt.title(col)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Key findings:
- Many numerical features showed [skewed/normal/bimodal] distributions
- Features like [list features] had significant outliers
- [Other notable patterns in numerical distributions]

### Correlation Analysis

I calculated correlations between numerical features:

```python
corr_matrix = df[numerical_cols].corr()
```

Key findings:
- Highly correlated feature pairs included: [list examples]
- The target variable showed strongest correlations with: [list features]
- Several features had correlations above the 0.75 threshold and were candidates for removal

## Categorical Features Analysis

I analyzed the distributions and relationships of categorical features:

```python
# Example of categorical analysis
for col in categorical_cols[:5]:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    counts = df[col].value_counts()
    sns.barplot(x=counts.index, y=counts.values)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {col}')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.show()
```

Key findings:
- Categorical features with highest cardinality (most unique values): [list features]
- Most frequent categories for key features: [examples]
- Categorical features with significant relationship to the target: [list features]

## Bivariate Analysis

I examined relationships between features and the target variable:

### Numerical Features vs Target

```python
# Example of numerical feature vs target analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
for i, col in enumerate(numerical_cols[:9]):
    plt.subplot(3, 3, i+1)
    sns.boxplot(x='TARGET', y=col, data=df)
    plt.title(f'{col} vs TARGET')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Key findings:
- Features showing clear separation between default/non-default cases: [list features]
- Features with no significant difference between classes: [list features]

### Categorical Features vs Target

```python
# Example of categorical feature vs target analysis
for col in categorical_cols[:5]:
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    pd.crosstab(df[col], df['TARGET'], normalize='index').plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)
    plt.title(f'{col} vs TARGET')
    plt.ylabel('Proportion')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.legend(['Non-Default (0)', 'Default (1)'])
    plt.show()
```

Key findings:
- Categorical features with strong predictive potential: [list features]
- Categories associated with higher default rates: [examples]

## Feature Importance Analysis

I performed a preliminary feature importance analysis using a simple model:

```python
# Example using Random Forest for feature importance
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_sample, y_sample)
importances = model.feature_importances_
```

Top features by importance:
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]
...

## Time-Based Analysis

If applicable, I analyzed temporal patterns in the data:

```python
# Example of time-based analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
df.groupby('DATE_COLUMN')['TARGET'].mean().plot()
plt.title('Default Rate Over Time')
plt.ylabel('Default Rate')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

Key findings:
- Seasonal patterns in default rates: [description]
- Long-term trends in loan performance: [description]

## Key Insights for Modeling

Based on the EDA, I identified several key insights that informed my modeling approach:

1. **Class Imbalance**: The significant imbalance in the target variable necessitated techniques like SMOTE to balance the training data.

2. **Important Predictors**: Features like [list top features] showed strong relationships with the target variable and were likely to be important predictors.

3. **Feature Engineering Opportunities**: The analysis suggested potential for feature engineering, such as [examples of potential feature engineering].

4. **Data Quality Issues**: Issues like [list issues] needed to be addressed in the data preprocessing stage.

5. **Modeling Approach**: The distribution of the data and relationships identified suggested that [model type] might perform well for this problem.

## Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the structure and patterns within the house loan dataset. These insights guided my decisions in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development, ultimately contributing to the effectiveness of the final predictive model.
