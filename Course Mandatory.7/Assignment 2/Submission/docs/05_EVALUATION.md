# Performance Assessment

This document provides a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning model built for the House Loan Data Analysis project.

## Evaluation Strategy

My evaluation strategy focused on understanding the model's performance in correctly identifying potential loan defaults, as this is the primary business objective. I used multiple metrics and visualization techniques to assess various aspects of model performance.

## Key Metrics

I selected the following key metrics to evaluate model performance:

### 1. Sensitivity (Recall)

Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual defaults correctly identified by the model:

```python
def calculate_sensitivity(y_true, y_pred):
    tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()
    sensitivity = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
    return sensitivity
```

Sensitivity is crucial in this domain because:
- Missing a potential default (false negative) is typically more costly than incorrectly flagging a non-default (false positive)
- High sensitivity ensures the model catches most actual defaults

### 2. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

AUC represents the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all possible classification thresholds:

```python
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_proba)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)
```

AUC is valuable because it:
- Is insensitive to class imbalance
- Provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible thresholds
- Ranges from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1.0 (perfect classification)

### 3. Precision

Precision measures the proportion of predicted defaults that are actual defaults:

```python
precision = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
```

Precision is important because:
- It reflects the cost of false alarms
- High precision means fewer resources wasted on investigating false positives

### 4. F1 Score

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

```python
f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) if (precision + recall) > 0 else 0
```

F1 score provides:
- Balance between precision and recall
- Single metric to optimize when both false positives and false negatives have costs

## Model Performance Results

### Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of predictions:

```
[True Negatives  False Positives]
[False Negatives True Positives]
```

From this matrix, I calculated:
- Sensitivity (Recall): [Value] (Proportion of actual defaults correctly identified)
- Specificity: [Value] (Proportion of non-defaults correctly identified)
- Precision: [Value] (Proportion of predicted defaults that were actual defaults)
- F1 Score: [Value] (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)

### ROC Curve Analysis

The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings:

Key results:
- AUC Score: [Value]
- Optimal threshold (based on business requirements): [Value]

### Precision-Recall Curve

The precision-recall curve shows the tradeoff between precision and recall at different thresholds:

Key results:
- Area Under Precision-Recall Curve: [Value]
- Optimal threshold (based on precision-recall tradeoff): [Value]

## Performance on Specific Segments

I analyzed model performance across different segments to identify any variations:

### Performance by Loan Amount

| Loan Amount Range | Sensitivity | Precision | F1 Score | Sample Size |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Low (< $X)        | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |
| Medium ($X-$Y)    | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |
| High (> $Y)       | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |

### Performance by Borrower Profile

| Borrower Profile       | Sensitivity | Precision | F1 Score | Sample Size |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| First-time borrowers   | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |
| Repeat borrowers       | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |
| High credit score      | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |
| Low credit score       | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value]     |

## Learning Curves Analysis

Analysis of the model's learning curves provides insights into the training process:

```python
plot_learning_curves(history)
```

Key observations:
- Training loss steadily decreased over epochs
- Validation loss [stabilized/increased] after [X] epochs, indicating [appropriate fit/potential overfitting]
- AUC showed consistent improvement until around epoch [X]
- Early stopping triggered at epoch [Y]

## Feature Importance

To understand which features contributed most to predictions, I performed a feature importance analysis:

```python
# Using a simpler model for interpretability
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced)
importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
```

Top 10 features by importance:
1. [Feature 1] - [Importance value]
2. [Feature 2] - [Importance value]
3. [Feature 3] - [Importance value]
...

This analysis revealed that:
- Features related to [category] had the highest predictive power
- [Other insights about feature importance]

## Error Analysis

I conducted an analysis of misclassified cases to understand model limitations:

### False Positives (Incorrectly Predicted Defaults)

Common characteristics of false positives:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]

### False Negatives (Missed Defaults)

Common characteristics of false negatives:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]

This analysis revealed potential areas for model improvement:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Insight 3]

## Comparison to Baseline Models

I compared the deep learning model's performance to simpler baseline models:

| Model                    | Sensitivity | Precision | F1 Score | AUC     |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression      | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value] |
| Random Forest            | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value] |
| Gradient Boosting        | [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value] |
| Deep Learning (Our Model)| [Value]     | [Value]   | [Value]  | [Value] |

The deep learning model showed [superior/comparable] performance, particularly in [specific metric].

   - Protected attributes should be carefully handled to ensure fair lending practices

4. **Monitoring Requirements**:
   - Regular performance monitoring needed to detect concept drift
   - Retraining strategy should be established based on performance degradation

## Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the evaluation, I recommend the following improvements:
