# Employee Turnover Analytics: Analysis Approach

## 1. Project Overview
Portobello Tech, an app innovator, needs to predict and analyze employee turnover using machine learning. The HR department periodically collects employee work data to identify patterns in work style and continued employment interest.

### 1.1 Business Context
- Employee turnover prediction is crucial for workforce management
- Data-driven approach to identify at-risk employees
- Proactive retention strategy development

### 1.2 Project Objectives
1. Data Quality Assessment
2. Turnover Factor Analysis
3. Employee Clustering
4. Class Imbalance Management
5. Model Development & Evaluation
6. Retention Strategy Formation

   - SMOTE implementation
   - Train-test split (80:20)

2. Model Training
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - 5-fold cross-validation

3. Model Evaluation
   - ROC/AUC analysis
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision vs Recall assessment

### 3.5 Risk Assessment
Employee categorization:
- Safe Zone (<20%)
- Low-Risk (20-60%)
- Medium-Risk (60-90%)
- High-Risk (>90%)

## 4. Success Criteria

### 4.1 Technical Metrics
